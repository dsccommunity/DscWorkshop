# Exercises

These small exercises should get you started with this repository and the project. Use these little tasks as a guideline, and be sure to replace settings with your own ones to improve your learning experience.

## Prerequisites

Before starting any exercise, please make sure you have met the following requirements:

- Create a free account on Azure DevOps if you don't have one yet: <https://dev.azure.com/>
- Create a free Azure test account if you don't have one yet with enough credits left: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/>. You may want to create a new email address if you already have one and used all your credits already (required to test Azure Automation DSC in a release pipeline)
- Create one or two virtual machines in the test subscription and donâ€™t forget to turn them off. The machine must have the status "deallocated", otherwise they are eating up your credits.
- Have a notebook computer (ideally Windows 10) with you that has the following software installed:
  - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  - [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
    - Install the PowerShell extensions
    - Install the RedHat yaml extension
    - Install the Az module (Install-Module -Name Az)
    - Test logging into your free Azure test subscription (Login-AzAccount)

Please execute the [prerequisite check](CheckPrereq.ps1) in Windows PowerShell to check if everything is configured correctly on you computer.

> ***Please note that this test requires Pester > 4 to run.***

## Task 1

Task 1 will get you into the DSC basics. You create a simple configuration, compile MOF file and apply the MOF file to your local machine

## Task 2

Task 2 is all about getting around the build environment step by step. From running a manual build to easily modifying the entire environment without modifying the actual DSC code you can experience everything.

## Task 3

Task 2 will get you going with your release pipeline on Azure DevOps and Azure DevOps Server. While this task is specific to Microsoft products like TFS/VSTS or Azure DevOps, the same principle applies to any CI system that lets you define build and release tasks like AppVeyor, TravisCI, Jenkins, ...
