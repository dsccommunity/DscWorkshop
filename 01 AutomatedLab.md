# PSConf EU 2018 - Lab Deployment Guide

The following guide explains how to setup the full lab environment containing a DSC Pull Server, SQL server as well as Team Foundation Server. 
You have two options to follow along:
- Use Hyper-V locally or Azure  
Best experience if you want to follow along with the entire lab
- ```git clone https://github.com/AutomatedLab/DscWorkshop```  
If you cannot use Azure and don't have the power to run the entire lab

## DSC with Azure DevOps Server

The full lab contains everything featured in Labs 01 and 02, which are not part of this workshop but can be used to test on your own. Additionally, it contains a TFS 2018 instance that powers our release pipeline as well as ProGet as the provider of a nuget feed.

  - 10GiB RAM for the lab VMs
  - At least 20GiB SSD storage for the lab VMs
- Azure
  - Azure PowerShell (```Install-Module AzureRM -Force```)

### Deployment

Follow these simple steps to create your own lab infrastructure for the workshop

1. Open Windows PowerShell, the ISE or VSCode as administrator
1. Create a new directory to contain the code and move there
1. Call ```git clone https://github.com/AutomatedLab/DscWorkshop``` inside the folder from step 2
1. ```Install-Module AutomatedLab -AllowClobber -Force```
  1. Azure only: ```Install-Module Az -Force```
1. ```New-LabSourcesFolder``` to download and create the proper folder structure
1. Copy your ISOs to the folder ISOs inside ```Get-LabSourcesLocation```
  1. Azure only: ```Connect-AzAccount```
  1. Azure only: ```New-LabAzureLabSourcesStorage -Location 'West Europe'```
  1. Azure only: Upload your TFS iso with ```Sync-LabAzureLabSources -DoNotSkipOsIsos -Filter *team_foundation*2018*```
1. Execute ```& '.\Lab\HyperV\03.10 Full Lab with DSC and TFS'``` on Hyper-V or ```& '.\Lab\Azure\03 Full Lab with DSC and TFS Azure.ps1'``` if you prefer to use Azure
1. After 1-2h the lab is fully deployed and you can follow the workshop
